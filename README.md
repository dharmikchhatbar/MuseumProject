🏛️ IoT Technologies to Enable Location-Based Services (LBS) for Smart Tourism
A minimalist application to enhance visitor engagement in museums using NFC, BLE, and QR codes.

📚 Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize the museum experience by integrating IoT technologies such as Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Quick Response (QR) codes, and Zigbee. It provides location-based services to museum visitors, making their visit more personalized, informative, and interactive.

The app is designed to:
	•	Deliver location-based content to visitors in real-time.
	•	Provide interactive multimedia experiences.
	•	Enhance navigation and engagement in cultural spaces.

🛠️ Features
	•	NFC Integration: Contactless interactions with exhibits to access detailed information.
	•	BLE Beacons: Indoor positioning for delivering context-aware content based on visitor proximity.
	•	QR Codes: Quick access to multimedia content, virtual tours, and additional information.
	•	Zigbee Technology: Establishes a connected environment for seamless data sharing between devices.

💻 Tech Stack
	•	Programming Language: Java (Android)
	•	Tools & Libraries: Android Bluetooth API, ZXing (QR Code Scanning), Zigbee Communication Libraries
	•	Framework: Android Studio
